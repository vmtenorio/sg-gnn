# Structure-Guided Input Graph for GNNs facing Heterophily

This repository contains the code for the paper "Structure-Guided Input Graph for GNNs facing Heterophily", by Victor M. Tenorio, Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Santiago Segarra and Antonio G. Marques. The paper was presented in the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers.

The code is organized as follows:

- The notebook `Experiments.ipynb` contains all the code used for the simulations and the visualizations in the paper.
- The file `arch.py` contains the code for the GNN architecture used, as well as the function to compute the role and global-based structural features.
